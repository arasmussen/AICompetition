--About--
This project's goal is to let users upload their chess AIs to our website and
then see how they compare to other user's AIs and also watch games online.

--Building--
I have the following environment variables defined in my .bashrc:

export CPP_CHESS_ROOT=~/chess
export PHP_CHESS_ROOT=C:/cygwin/home/Andrew/chess
export BOOST_DIR=/usr/include/boost
export THRIFT_CPP_DIR=/usr/thrift-0.8.0/lib/cpp/src
export THRIFT_PHP_DIR=C:/cygwin/usr/thrift-0.8.0/lib/php/src
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export CHESS_READ_PASSWORD={read password}
export CHESS_WRITE_PASSWORD={write password}

Since Andrew's developing in Cygwin, g++ uses cygwin style paths and php uses
windows style paths, which is why we have a separate path for CPP_CHESS_ROOT and
PHP_CHESS_ROOT even though they are both technically the root directory. We are
still looking for a workaround for this.

After setting up environment variables, go to chess/server/cpp and make, which
will place the startServer binary in chess/bin. Running this will start a
service which will be able to keep track of current games initiated from php
code in chess/server/php via thrift.
