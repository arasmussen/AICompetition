--About--
Venzio is a website which hosts AI competitions.

--Building--
I have defined the following environment variables in my httpd.conf using
SetEnv.

export VENZIO_ROOT=/home/ec2-user/www/venzio
export VENZIO_READ_PASSWORD={read password}
export VENZIO_WRITE_PASSWORD={write password}
export VENZIO_ADMIN_PASSWORD={admin password}

--Database Backup--
Everytime you make a git commit on the ec2 server, VENZIO_ROOT/pre-commit.sh is
run, which currently dumps the database into VENZIO_ROOT/web/db.sql. This is
convenient so that you can have the same copy of the database as the server,
including tables, data, everything. You'll have to set a symlink from
.git/hooks/pre-commit to this file by doing the following:

ln -s $VENZIO_ROOT/.pre-commit.sh $VENZIO_ROOT/.git/hooks/pre-commit

Note that this means that your db copy will also be committed to the server
every time you commit, so make sure you only do this if you want that to happen.
